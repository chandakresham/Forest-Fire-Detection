# Forest-Fire-Detection
##### Dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alik05/forest-fire-dataset/data
##### Modules used: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn.metrics, opencv, tensorflow, tensorflow.keras.preprocessing  
1. In this project, I have used Convolutional Neural Networks(CNN) to classify training and testing images.
2. I have found out the training and testing accuracy, confusion matrix and other metrics.
3. For testing, I have taken 1 image from the test dataset and predicted whether that image is having fire or not. I have also find out heatmap of that image.
